##### Exercises, Projects and Research

Following every section, you will find some combination of sub-sections titled Exercises, Projects and/or Research. These sections are to test yourself and interact with the material more deeply. They can be used as follows:
- Exercises: Like any textbook these are your traditional exercises or problem sets. They are labeled with varying difficulty and will generally have a well-defined answer or at least one that can be found by reading this book. Some exercises will take longer than others to complete, but an advanced student shouldn't find themselves spending too much time to come up with an adequate answer at least. Solutions* to exercises are listed on the book's website. (Not all solutions are definite, or the only possible answers.)
- Projects: Longer and more in-depth than the exercises, Projects will generally take a reader a considerable amount of time to complete. They are generally left open-ended to let your imagination turn them into whatever you like, but some are labeled either solved or verifiable. Projects labeled solved have source code listed on the book's website, while verifiable projects mean you can upload your solution on the book's website to be tested for completeness.
- Research: Questions in this section follow a similar pattern to "Exercises" except they are completely open-ended, and you are almost guaranteed not to be able to find an answer in this book (at least at that point in reading). This is your opportunity to practice a Computer Scientist's greatest skill: research. 

##### Style and Notation

`C-x` means `CONTROL+x`

With commands and other _, things wrapped in:
