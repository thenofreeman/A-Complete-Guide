##### Research

1. Find a new language and create the equivalent of a "Hello, World" program in that language. Then, answer some of the following questions:
    - What style does this language use?
    - What are the benefits of using this language over the ones learned previously?
    - For what purpose was this language developed?

    A few unconventional languages to consider:
    - lisp
    - vimscript
    - ruby
