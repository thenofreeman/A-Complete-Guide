### "Hello, World!"

A "Hello, World!" program is generally the bare-minimum code you need to run for in a language to test if everything is configured properly so that you may begin writing more elaborate programs. 

They generally output some text and optionally get some input from the user.

"Hello, World!" is a notational convention that dates back to the 1970s with the C programming language.
